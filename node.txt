API - Application Programming Interface
 Api helps any client to communicate with server, it follows http protocol
 HTTP is a protocal that is used as a medium to make api reuests.
 Api is nothing but REST API(Representational state Transfer), Rest api uses JSON for data format.

REST Api can transfer data in Json, Text, JS, Html formats, to client to server and vice versa.
REST API Methods - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

In request call these are important - Request Headers, Request Body Params, to know from where request is coming and to where and 
  some additional data.  

Cookie - Cookie is small data,token that is sent from server to client, cookie is stored automatically in clients browser.

 the client, how many times client and send request, and client details.
